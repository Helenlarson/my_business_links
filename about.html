            <h1 class="apresentacao__conteudo__titulo">About me</h1>
            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">I am from Brazil, and in 2013, I embarked on a journey to the United States as part
                    of an international cultural exchange program. Today, I call Colorado home. I am a professional with 10 years of experience 
                    caring for children. I began specializing in newborn and postpartum care after realizing 
                    that my true passion lies in working with newborns alongside their families.

                        My studies and training ensure the highest level of care for my clients and their newborns. I believe in creating a nurturing 
                        and supportive environment where you and your baby can thrive.
                        I'm here to support you with breastfeeding, offer guidance on newborn care, and provide practical tips to help you feel confident
                        in your parenting journey. I am here to provide non-judgmental support and guidance tailored 
                        to your unique needs. I am committed to fostering a warm and loving atmosphere, where you feel comfortable and cared for.</p>
                <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">My approach to newborn care uses an evidence based practices. I am passionate about creating a 
                strong bond between you and your baby, encouraging positive parentchild interactions and providing you with the tools and knowledge to develop
                your own parenting style. My experience includes both singletons and multiples. Outside of this amazing life as a Newborn Care Specialist, I am a dog mom.
                I love traveling to new places and visiting Brazil to spend quality time with my beloved family.
